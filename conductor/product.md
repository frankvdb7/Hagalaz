# Initial Concept
A modern, full-stack recreation of a classic MMORPG, built with a microservice architecture and designed for scalability, maintainability, and a rich developer experience.

# Product Definition

## Target Audience
- **Open-source Contributors**: Developers looking to engage with modern .NET 10 microservices and .NET Aspire orchestration.
- **Retro Gamers**: Fans of the original MMORPG seeking a nostalgic but technically superior experience.
- **Private Server Administrators**: Operators looking for a robust, scalable, and modern backend for game hosting.

## Core Goals
- **High Performance & Scalability**: Utilizing a microservice architecture to support high concurrent player counts reliably.
- **Extensibility & Modularity**: A system designed for easy feature additions and modifications without disrupting the core.
- **Faithfulness to the Original**: Recreating the mechanics and atmosphere of the classic game with high fidelity.

## Key Features (MVP)

- **Persistent World & Networking**: State-of-the-art player synchronization and persistent storage of character data.
- **Core Combat & NPC Interactions**: Implementing foundational battle mechanics and a reactive world environment.

## Design Philosophy (The "Hagalaz" Spirit)
- **Iterative Refinement**: Prioritizing growth and renewal through frequent updates and feedback loops.
- **Modernized Mechanics**: Improving user experience by smoothing out legacy friction while preserving the core gameplay loops.
- **Community-Driven**: Building a feedback-first culture where contributors and players directly influence the project's evolution.

## Developer Experience (DX)
- **Modular Architecture**: Deep decoupling to allow developers to work on isolated services with minimal friction.
- **Robust Tooling & CI/CD**: High automation for development tasks and a strong focus on automated testing and reliability.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides and documentation to lower the barrier to entry for new contributors.
