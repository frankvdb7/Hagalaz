# Product Guidelines

## Communication Style
- **Tone**: Enthusiastic, approachable, and community-focused. We want to inspire contributors and gamers alike by sharing the excitement of the recreation.
- **Messaging**: Highlight the "spirit" of growth and transformation (Hagalaz). Documentation should be friendly and encouraging, making it easy for anyone to get involved.

## Visual Identity & Branding
- **The "Hagalaz" Fusion**: Our identity is a blend of modern technical sleekness, nostalgic retro vibes, and natural storm elements.
- **Design Elements**: Use high-contrast, sharp lines (Modern) combined with color palettes that evoke the classic game's era (Retro). Incorporate "Hail" and "Storm" motifs (Nature) to reinforce our namesake.

## Community & Contribution
- **Radical Transparency**: All major design decisions and the project roadmap are public. We build in the open to foster trust and collaboration.
- **Inclusivity & Merit**: While we prioritize high-quality code and design, we ensure a welcoming environment for contributors of all skill levels.
- **Stewardship Decision Making**: The core team acts as stewards of the project's vision. We actively solicit community input but make final decisions based on the core goals of performance, faithfulness, and extensibility.

## Documentation & Code Style (Prose)
- **Code Clarity**: We strive for self-documenting code through expressive naming and clear structure.
- **Structured Documentation**: Use JSDoc-style (or language-equivalent) comment blocks for all public APIs and complex logic to ensure the "rich developer experience" promised in our vision.
