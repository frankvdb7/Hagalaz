## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us confidentially. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed.**

To report a vulnerability, please use the **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature. This is the preferred method as it ensures your report is delivered directly to the project maintainers. You can find this feature under the "Security" tab of the repository.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following information:

-   A detailed description of the vulnerability, including the steps to reproduce it.
-   The version of Hagalaz you are using.
-   Any relevant logs, screenshots, or other supporting materials.

You can expect a response from us within 48 hours to acknowledge receipt of your report. We will do our best to keep you informed of our progress in addressing the vulnerability.
